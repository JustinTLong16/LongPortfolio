            was a cookie clicker app that they had a tutorial on. I would get back into coding come sophmore year when i took the Computer Science course at new tech and we wouldnt do much more
            than basic block coding and some python. The next year i applied and got accepted into the SICTC Computer Science and Software Development course where i would learn much more in depth
            Python scripts, as well as learning intermediate HTML/CSS and some Javascript as well. Im also in my opinion a pretty good editor, mainly ive made stuff for school projects.
             To Continue exploring, use the nav bar off to the side!

        <h2>My Future Plans!</h2>
        <p>I have many routes i am looking down, ive looked at a couple colleges, and even a couple businesses. I could do what my dad does and just do independant mechanical
            inspections, but id much rather do something related to computer science and coding, because this is what i have the most fun doing. If i do go to college it would 
            probably be UCA (University of Central Arkansas) or USI (University of Southern Indiana), and im shooting to raise my grades to the point that if i do decide i wanna
            go, i can but im not limiting myself to just that. At this point im kinda just exploring around and testing all my options, seeing what i do and dont like, ive 
            looked into some computer science jobs but not nearly enough to include much of note here.
