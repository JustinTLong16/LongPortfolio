         <figcaption class="caption">I Am Justin Long, the man who developed this website. I began coding when i was young with block coding on my ipad thanks to some app, i built one thing on there and that
            was a cookie clicker app that they had a tutorial on. I would get back into coding come sophmore year when i took the Computer Science course at new tech and we wouldnt do much more
            than basic block coding and some python. The next year i applied and got accepted into the SICTC Computer Science and Software Development course where i would learn much more in depth
            Python scripts, as well as learning intermediate HTML/CSS and some Javascript as well. Im also in my opinion a pretty good editor, mainly ive made stuff for school projects.
